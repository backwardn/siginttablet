This is the repository for a Signals Intelligence Tablet, as I will be discussing at the 2019 CircleCityCon

--------------------------------------------
“Who said something? What did they say? Where did they say it? What can I do with it?” These are the questions people have when working with unknown radio systems. This is the art and science of Signals Intelligence (SigInt).

We discuss the basic requirements for working with SigInt, along with a sample platform using a Raspberry Pi and a RTLSDR radio receiver. The discussion will then briefly touch on other hardware that can enable SigInt work, that are not incorporated in the demo platform. We then dive into the software stack that makes SigInt work.

The following software will be used: Linux (Raspbian), RPITX, RTLSDR libraries, GnuRadio (gr-inspector), GQRX, and other accompanying tools. We will use FCC ID’s, manual scanning of spectrum, and gr-inspector to find and target potentially vulnerable frequencies and protocols as well as show how exploits could commence. We will attempt a live demo of such an attack using a system the presenter brings in.

This document will be populated appropriately showing an assembly, recommended 3d printing settings, electrical routing, and configurations for the Raspbian and accompanying software.
