To slice, I used Slic3r.

I'm using a .4mm nozzle, with .2mm layer height for all layers
I set infill to 40%, honeycomb.
I set Horizontal shells (bottom AND top) to 0. This expresses the infill to the seethrough effect I have

Once you regenerate the slice, view the layers tab on the bottom of the 3d interface. 
You want to check and verify the layers are doing what you want. 

Once you're happy with how the lid effect is expressed, generate the GCode and send to printer
