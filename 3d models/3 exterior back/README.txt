If you have printed the "exterior back.stl" model, and you wish to incorporate a CrazyRadio without another 16h print, do the following:

1. Get a drill with a multitude of bits. 
2. Determine where you want the antenna.
3. Use the smallest bit to start the hole.
4. Work your way up slowly until you get between 6-7mm dia (or whatever that is in imperial)
5. Then work your SMA into the hole, and then tighten the nut. You might have to go back to step 4 if its too small. 
6. Done!
