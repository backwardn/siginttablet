You will need a set of programs to work with these files.

The .fcstd is FreeCAD's data format. This software is Free Software and available for Windows/Mac/Linux. https://www.freecadweb.org/

The .stl's are provided for convenience and are a quick way to print the model. You should never edit STLs. Crappy triangles are crappy. I suggest using MeshLab for visual verification of a model. http://www.meshlab.net/

You will need a slicer to slice the STL to the appropriate gcode for your printer. I will not provide GCode files, since they will *not* work on your printer, unless you built the exact model. 


I would suggest for models 1-4, to print with 100% infill. For #5 (the lid), I have made specific instruction recomenndations for that in the directory.
