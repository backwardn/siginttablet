This is a list of materials you will need to complete this tablet.

Please be aware, that since the product links are to a variety of auction sites, these prices **WILL** change. I also considered a few things as 0 cost. For example, USB cables are ubiquitious. We cut a few up. 

I also have a large format 3d printer. You probably don't. I didn't include cost for printables, or nuts and bolts. I buy in quantity from Fastenal or McMaster Carr. 

Total cost tally as of 17 Feb 2019: $157.50
